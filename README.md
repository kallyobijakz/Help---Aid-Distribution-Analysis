# Help---Aid-Distribution-Analysis

## Overview
Help is focused on identifying countries with the most urgent needs related to economic hardship and health challenges. The goal of this project is to leverage data insights to guide the allocation of $30 million in donations. The analysis emphasizes prioritizing countries with low GDP per capita (gdpp) and low life expectancy, aiming to target resources to areas in critical condition. This data-driven approach will allow Help to make impactful and strategic decisions in aid distribution.

## Objectives
1. Group Countries Based on Key Indicators
Use unsupervised learning to cluster countries by GDP per capita and life expectancy.
Group countries optimally to highlight those with severe economic and health challenges.
2. Identify and Prioritize High-Need Countries
Identify countries within each cluster that represent critical needs and require urgent aid allocation.
Develop a prioritized list of countries to optimize the distribution of the available funds for maximum impact.
3. Visualize Findings
Use geographic mapping to visualize the clustered countries and highlight those requiring immediate attention.

## Methodology
Data Analysis & Modeling
Step 1: Data Preparation
Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure accurate clustering.
Standardize features such as GDP per capita (gdpp) and life expectancy to enhance model performance.
Step 2: Clustering with KMeans
Apply KMeans clustering, an unsupervised learning model, to group countries based on GDP per capita and life expectancy.
Experiment with the optimal number of clusters to reveal distinct groups, enabling targeted aid distribution to countries in the highest need.
Step 3: Identify Priority Countries
Analyze clusters to identify the countries with the lowest GDP per capita and life expectancy within each group.
Generate a prioritized list of high-need countries for aid distribution based on the clustering output.
Step 4: Geographic Visualization
Use a geographic Python library, such as Geopandas or Folium, to map the results.
Highlight the countries identified as top-priority for aid, providing an intuitive view of the geographic areas most in need.

## Models Used
The clustering model used for this analysis was KMeans, an unsupervised learning algorithm ideal for grouping countries based on similarities in GDP per capita and life expectancy. The optimal cluster number was determined to maximize the effectiveness of grouping, ensuring that countries with critical needs were clearly identified.

## Features
GDP per capita (gdpp): Measures economic output; countries with low GDP per capita indicate higher economic need.
Life Expectancy: Reflects health outcomes; countries with lower life expectancy show greater vulnerability in health-related factors.

## Usage
Data Input:
Load the preprocessed country dataset, including GDP per capita and life expectancy for clustering analysis.

Model Training:
Run the KMeans model on the dataset to generate clusters that group countries by need.

Prioritization:
Extract the list of countries in the clusters with the lowest GDP per capita and life expectancy to prioritize for aid.

Visualization:
Use the geographic visualization tool to map and visually represent the prioritized countries for effective decision-making.

## Results
The analysis revealed clusters of countries with low GDP per capita and life expectancy. These countries are identified as being in the most critical need for resources. Geographic visualization highlighted these high-need areas, providing Help with a clear, data-driven understanding of where aid can be most impactful.

## Conclusion
This project leverages KMeans clustering to group countries based on economic and health metrics, allowing Help to prioritize aid distribution effectively. Geographic visualization tools further enhance the decision-making process, presenting a clear map of areas that would benefit most from immediate intervention. By focusing on countries at the epicenter of need, Help can allocate resources in a way that maximizes the positive impact of the donation fund.
